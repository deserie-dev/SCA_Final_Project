<summary><b>Launching A GCP Virtual Machine from AMI Image Using Terraform</b></summary><p>

In order for Terraform to be able to provision the infrastructure needed for this project, first setup GCP in the following way:

1. Create a GCP Project: GCP organizes resources into projects. Create one now in the GCP console and make note of the project ID. You can see a list of your projects in the cloud resource manager.

Google Compute Engine: Enable Google Compute Engine for your project in the GCP console. Make sure to select the project you are using to follow this tutorial and click the "Enable" button.

A GCP service account key: Create a service account key to enable Terraform to access your GCP account. When creating the key, use the following settings:

Select the project you created in the previous step.
Click "Create Service Account".
Give it any name you like and click "Create".
For the Role, choose "Project -> Editor", then click "Continue".
Skip granting additional users access, and click "Done".
After you create your service account, download your service account key.

Select your service account from the list.
Select the "Keys" tab.
In the drop down menu, select "Create new key".
Leave the "Key Type" as JSON.
Click "Create" to create the key and save the key file to your system.
